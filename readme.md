# Going Slow

### This is a small-ish overhaul mod that makes the game more primitive in its technology, kinda like Factorio from another timeline. It mostly has a steampunk asthetic, with most (but not all) machines being powered by steam.

## WARNING: This is a VERY early version, with very little playtesting
